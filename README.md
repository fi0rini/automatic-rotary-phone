# automatic-rotary-phone

fully built webpack-dev-server react HMR (barebones) https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/

There are two branches with working HMR versions:
1. Browser [#master](../master/README.md) 
2. Electron [#electron](./README.md) < currently here

## Electron
```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

`cmd` + `r` is *usually* required after server is done loading - I would like to fix this - but skipping for now...

Make changes to ./src/App/js and save - see result update in electron window.

*usually* - because I'm not sure if it's every time.
